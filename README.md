# Coffee Order Management System

This project implements a **Coffee Order Management System** using a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** in Python. The application allows users to create, process, and reset coffee orders while demonstrating the use of key design patterns: **Command Pattern**, **Observer Pattern**, **Factory Pattern**, and elements of the **Strategy Pattern**.

## Features

1. **Order Coffee**
   - Select coffee type, sugar level, and additional options (e.g., milk, cream, etc.).
   - Input a custom name to be written on the cup.

2. **Process Orders**
   - Simulate the preparation and display the order summary.

3. **Reset Input**
   - Clear all fields for a new order.

4. **Design Patterns Implemented**
   - **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates user actions (e.g., order processing) as commands.
   - **Observer Pattern:** Handles event-driven programming via user interactions.
   - **Factory Pattern:** Manages dynamic creation of GUI components and options.
   - **Strategy Pattern:** Allows easy extension with new coffee types or features.
